YOLOv5 Object Detection System

Overview

This project implements a comprehensive object detection system using the YOLOv5 model. Built with PyQt5 for a user-friendly graphical interface, the application allows users to perform real-time object detection on images and video streams seamlessly.

Features

Image Detection: Upload images and detect objects with bounding boxes and labels. Video Detection: Support for real-time detection using webcam or video files. Model Switching: Easily switch between different YOLO models for various detection tasks. Result Visualization: Display detection results directly in the application with options to save the output images and logs. User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive GUI designed with PyQt5 for easy navigation and interaction.

Requirements

Python 3.x PyQt5 OpenCV Torch and torchvision YOLOv5 model files
